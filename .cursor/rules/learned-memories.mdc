## Collaboration Workflow

1.  **Task Management**:
    *   Always use a task list for making changes. Task lists should be located in markdown files under `docs/tasks/` (e.g., `docs/tasks/TASKS.md` or `docs/tasks/FEATURE_NAME.md`).
    *   Review the task list before starting any work.
    *   Consult `./docs/app.md` (if it exists) to ensure task list accuracy.

2.  **Task Completion & Verification**:
    *   After completing a task, build the application.
    *   Check for and resolve any errors or warnings from the build process.

3.  **Approval and Finalization**:
    *   After a task is locally completed and verified (built, errors/warnings resolved), ask for user approval before finalizing it and moving to the next task.
    *   Upon receiving user approval to finalize a task:
        1.  Update the `/docs/app.md` file with relevant changes.
        2.  Update the task list (mark task as completed).
        3.  Commit all changes to git.
    *   Proceed to the next task only after these finalization steps are complete.
