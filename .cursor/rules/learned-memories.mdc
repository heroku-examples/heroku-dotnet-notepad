-   **App Documentation:** Use information from `./docs/app.md` if it exists.
-   **Task List Review:** Before making any changes, present a task list for review.
-   **Post-Task Build & Check:** After completing each task, build the application and check for/resolve any errors or warnings.
-   **Approval Before Finalizing:** After a task is marked as completed, always ask for user approval before finalizing it and moving to the next task.
-   **Finalization Steps (Post-Approval):**
    1.  Update the `/docs/app.md` file.
    2.  Update the relevant task list.
    3.  Commit all changes to git.
-   Only after these finalization steps, move to the next task.
